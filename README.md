[00:14.07] A hero stood before us
[00:16.99] Her blood spilled on the ground
[00:20.25] She may be gone but her will stays
[00:37.25] 
[00:25.89] The fight is not over
[00:29.03] I pick up where she left
[00:32.36] Her legacy to carry on
[00:36.47] Burning
[00:39.97] 
[00:38.62] This battlefield is tainted
[00:41.46] Blood and tears the soil painted
[00:44.46] Many have fell but I always stay alive
[00:49.44] Won't go down
[00:50.48] Pick up my gun and fight
[00:52.44] Time to see the end of my destiny
[00:55.89] Stay alive, until I fill my duty
[01:11.89] 
[01:03.02] Here is my fire
[01:05.85] The torch burns brighter, I am braver
[01:10.09] A goddess with the power to stand tall
[01:14.66] Rising higher
[01:18.14] See who I have become now
[01:22.33] Take a look at the best of me
[01:24.69] Searching for the answer bracing on my name
[01:46.19] 
[01:46.86] The fight is not over
[01:49.66] I pick up where she left
[01:52.28] Her legacy to carry on
[01:56.72] Burning
[02:00.22] 
[01:58.81] This battlefield is tainted
[02:01.52] Blood and tears the soil painted
[02:04.54] Many have fell but I always stay alive
[02:09.76] Won't go down
[02:11.23] Pick up my gun and fight
[02:12.92] It's time to see the end of my destiny
[02:16.03] Stay alive, until I fill my duty
[02:32.03] 
[02:23.22] Here is my fire
[02:26.68] The torch burns brighter, I am braver
[02:30.02] A goddess with the power to stand tall
[02:35.34] Rising higher
[02:38.73] See who I have become now
[02:42.78] Take a look at the best of me
[02:45.15] Searching for the answer bracing on my name
[03:06.65] 
[03:07.30] I gotta follow my destiny
[03:09.54] Searching for the answer, this is my day
[03:12.70] I gotta follow my destiny
[03:15.47] Surging with the power, chasing what I stand
